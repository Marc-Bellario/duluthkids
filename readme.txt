This is an-the initial repository on git for
duluthkids.net -
the code is in progress -

Very quickly (today ? 9-24) I am planning 
to upload a version of a bulletin board(forum)- 
using flask(python) - and pymongo - 
originally written using flask & sqlite 
by Copyright (C) 2011 Tom Dryer
https://github.com/tdryer/flask-forum/blob/master/app.py
I have contacted Tom about this ()
I am currently working on a forum 
using mongoengine - which I am hoping
is a little more close to what I
am shooting at via duluthkids.
