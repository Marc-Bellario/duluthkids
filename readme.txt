This is an-the initial repository on git for
duluthkids.net -
the code is in progress -

Very quickly (today ? 9-24) I am planning 
to upload a version of a bulletin board(forum)- 
using flask(python) - and pymongo - 
originally written using flask & sqlite 
by Copyright (C) 2011 Tom Dryer
https://github.com/tdryer/flask-forum/blob/master/app.py
I have contacted Tom about this ()
I am currently working on a forum 
using mongoengine - which I am hoping
is a little more close to what I
am shooting at via duluthkids.

added base code for the demo version of duluthkids.net
this is directory newforum6

this code is base on loosely combining two code bases -
https://github.com/akprasad/flask-forum
and 
https://github.com/dakrauth/django-swingtime

both of which are written for sql type database -

Newforum6 is based on mongoengine and also heavily
depends on flask-admin.  It is a demo project for
duluthkids.net - designed to introduce users to its
functionality.
